        received an initial endowment of 100 points and have to decide on the number of points 
        that you will send to Participant B.
        This amount can be any integer between 0 and {{ C.WAGE_MAX }} points.
        After observing the number of points they received, Participant B 
        will select a multiplier. 
        Multipliers are costly for Participant B.
        Below, you find a table that shows the multipliers 
        that Participant B can choose from and their costs to Participant B.
        The multiplier that Participant B chooses determines your payoff. 
        Your payoff will be calculated as (your endowment - number of points sent to Participant B) times the multiplier selected by Participant B.
        The payoff of Participant B will be calculated as the number of points you sent to Participant B minus the cost of the multiplier selected by Participant B.
        In summary:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your payoff = (100 - number of points you send to Participant B) * multiplier selected by Participant B</li>
        <li>Payoff Participant B = number of points you send to Participant B * cost of multiplier selected by Participant B</li>
    </ul>
