        Let's see whether you correctly understood how the payoffs are determined.
    </p>
    <p>
        The setting was: 
        "Participant A sends 10 points, and Participant B chooses a multiplier of 0.3."
    </p>
    <p>You answered:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Participant A's payoff is {{ player.comprehension_check_pre1 }}.</li>
        <li>Participant B's payoff is {{ player.comprehension_check_pre2 }}.</li>
    </ul>
    {{ if both_correct }}
        <p>
            <strong>Great! You answered both questions correctly.</strong>
        </p>

        The payoffs of the participants in the setting below are
        calculated as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The initial endowment of Participant A is 100 points. 
            Participant B has an initial endowment of zero.</li>
        <li>Participant A sent 10 points to Participant B, 
            reducing their endowment from 100 to 90 points.</li>
        <li>Participant B chose a multiplier of 0.3.</li>
        <li>According to the table below, this implies a cost of 2 points.</li>
        <li>Participant B's payoff is 10 points (the amount received) 
            - 2 points (the cost) = <strong>8 points</strong>.</li>
        <li>Participant A's payoff is the endowment after 
            sending the amount (100 - 10) = 90 points times 
            the multiplier chosen by participant B (0.3)
            = <strong>27 points</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
