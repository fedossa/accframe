    <p>
        Thank you for taking these comprehension checks.
        Let's see whether you understood how the payoffs are determined.
    </p>
    <p>
        The setting was: 
        "The firm sets a wage of 10 and the manager decides 
        for an effort level of 0.3."
    </p>
    <p>You answered</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The firm's payoff is {{ player.comprehension_check_pre1 }}.</li>
        <li>The manager's payoff is {{ player.comprehension_check_pre2 }}.</li>
    </ul>
    {{ if both_correct }}
        <p>
            <strong>Great! You answered both questions correctly.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Below you can find the calculation of the payoffs for this 
            setting and a copy of the instructions from the previous page 
            for your reference. Press 'Next' when you are ready to start 
            the experiment.

            <strong>
                Unfortunately, you answered at least one question incorrectly.

            Please carefully inspect the calculations below to understand
            where your mistake was. You can also review the instructions
            from the previous page copied below for your reference.

        The payoffs of the participants for the setting below are
        calculated as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each round, the initial endowment of the firm is 100 points. 
            The manager has an initial endowment of zero.</li>
        <li>The firm rewarded the manager a wage of 10 points, 
            reducing its endowment from 100 to 90 points.</li>
        <li>The manager decided for an effort level of 0.3.</li>
        <li>Following the table below this implies a cost of 2 points.</li>
        <li>The manager's payoff is 10 points (the wage received) 
            - 2 points (the effort cost) = <strong>8 points</strong>.</li>
        <li>The firm's payoff is the endowment after 
            sending the amount (100 - 10) = 90 points times 
            the effort level chosen by the manager (0.3)
            = <strong>27 points</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
