    <p>
        Thank you for taking these comprehension checks.
        Let's see whether you understood how the payoffs are determined.
    </p>
    <p>
        The setting was: 
        "The supervisory board has decided to compensate the manager with 
        10 and the manager has decided to choose an effort cost of 2."
    </p>
    <p>You answered</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Supervisory board payoff is {{ player.comprehension_check_pre1 }}.</li>
        <li>Manager payoff is {{ player.comprehension_check_pre2 }}.</li>
    </ul>
    {{ if both_correct }}
        <p>
            <strong>Great! You answered both questions correctly.</strong>
        </p>

            Below you can find the calculation of the payoffs for this 
            setting and a copy of the instructions from the previous page 
            for your reference. Press 'Next' when you are ready to start 
            the experiment.

            Please carefully inspect the calculations below to understand
            where your mistake was. You can also review the instructions
            from the previous page copied below for your reference.

        The payoffs of the participants for the setting below are
        calculated as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The supervisory board awards a compensation of 10 to the manager, 
            reducing the initial firm value from 100 to 90.</li>
        <li>Based on this conversation, the manager decides for an effort level 
            leading to effort costs of 2.</li>
        <li>Following the table below this implies a effort multiplier of 0.3.</li>
        <li>The payoff for the manager is 10 (his or her compensation) 
            - 2 (the effort costs) = <strong>8</strong>.</li>
        <li>The payoff of the supervisory board is the product of the 
            effort multiplier as chosen by the manager (0.3) 
            with initial firm value after compensation (100 - 10 = 90) = 
            <strong>27</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
