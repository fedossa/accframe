        supervisory board has awarded you a compensation of {{ group.wage }}. 
        Based on this you can now choose your effort level. This effort level
        will reduce your payoff by causing effort costs while at the same 
        time affecting the firm value. You find the link between effort cost 
        and effort multiple in the table below.

        Remember that the payoff of the supervisory board will be calculated 
        as the product of the effort multiplier chosen by you with the 
        difference of the initial firm value of 100 minus your compensation.       
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your Payoff = Compensation received from supervisory board - Effort Cost</li>
        <li>Payoff Supervisory Board  = Effort Multiplier chosen by you * (100 - Your compensation)</li>
