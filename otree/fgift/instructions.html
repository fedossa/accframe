<p> 
    This is an experiment on managers' compensation and effort.
    You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
    In the experiment, there are two roles: firm and manager.
    The roles are randomly assigned to you and the other participant. 
    You will learn whether your role is firm or manager prior to making any decision.
</p>
<p>
    In the experiment, you and the other participant can earn points. 
    Points will be exchanged for money at the end of the experiment.
    {{ if C.NUM_ROUNDS > 1 }}
        This experiment consists of {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds.
        Throughout the experiment, you will remain in the same role.
        The points that you earn in each round are added up.
        A round proceeds as follows:
    {{ endif }}
    The firm starts with an endowment of 100 points. 
    The manager starts with an endowment of 0 points. 
    First, the firm decides about the wage for the manager.
    The wage can be any integer between 0 and {{ C.WAGE_MAX }}.
    The wage is transferred from the firm to the manager.
    Next, the manager selects an effort level from the table below. 
    The effort level selected by the manager determines the payoff of the firm.
    Specifically, the payoff of the firm is calculated as follows:
</p>
<p>
    (100 - wage paid to manager) * effort level. 
</p>
<p>
    The manager can select effort levels between 0.1 and 1.0. 
    Higher effort levels are more costly for the manager. 
</p>
<p>
    In summary, the payoffs are calculated as follows:
</p>        
<ul>
    <li>Payoff firm = (100 - wage paid to manager) * effort level </li>
    <li>Payoff manager = wage received from firm - cost of effort level </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Example:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Suppose that the firm chooses to award the manager a wage of 40 points 
            and that the manager then chooses the effort level 0.7, which costs 10 points. 
            The payoff of the firm then is (100 points - 40 points) * 0.7 = 42 points. 
            The payoff of the manager then is 40 points - 10 points = 30 points.
        </li>
    </ul>
