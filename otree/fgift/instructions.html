<p> 
    This is an experiment on managers' compensation and effort.
    Your objective in this experiment is maximizing your points. 
    You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
    In the experiment, there are two roles: firm and manager.
    The roles are randomly assigned to you and the other participant. 
    You will learn whether your role is participant A or participant B prior to making any decision.
</p>
<p>
    {{ if C.NUM_ROUNDS == 1 }}
        This experiment will be played for only 1 round. The firm
    {{ else }} 
        This experiment will be played over {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds.
        The points that you receive in each round are accumulated.
        Throughout the experiment, you will remain in the same role.
        Each round, the firm
    {{ endif }}
    starts with an endowment of 100 points 
    and the manager starts with an endowment of 0 points. 
    First, the firm decides how many points they want to transfer to the manager.
    This transfer represents the wage paid to the manager by the firm.
    The wage can be any integer between 0 and {{ C.WAGE_MAX }}.
    Next, the manager selects an effort level from the table below. 
    The effort level selected by the manager determines the payoff of the firm.
    Specifically, the payoff of the firm is calculated as follows:
</p>
<p>
    (100 - wage paid to manager) * effort level. 
</p>
<p>
    The manager can select effort levels between 0.1 and 1.0. 
    Higher effort levels are more costly for the manager. 
</p>
<p>
    In summary, the payoffs are calculated as follows:
</p>        
<ul>
    <li>Payoff firm = (100 - wage paid to manager) * effort level </li>
    <li>Payoff participant B = wage received from firm - cost of effort level </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Example:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Suppose that the firm chooses to award the manager a wage of 30 points 
            and that the manager then chooses the effort level 0.7, which costs 10 points. 
            The payoff of the firm then is (100 points - 30 points) * 0.7 = 49 points. 
            The payoff of the manager then is 30 points - 10 points = 20 points.
        </li>
    </ul>
