        have received an initial endowment of 100 and have to decide on the wage 
        that you will reward to the manager.
        This wage can be any integer between 0 and {{ C.WAGE_MAX }}.
        Based on the wage that they has received, the manager 
        will choose their effort level, inducing a cost.
        Below, you will again find the table that links the effort level 
        that the manager can choose to its cost for your reference.
        This effort level will determine your payoff. Your payoff 
        will be calculated as the product of the effort level with
        the difference of your endowment of 100 points 
        minus the wage sent to the manager.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your payoff = (100 - wage paid to manager) * effort level</li>
        <li>Payoff manager = wage paid by you - cost of effort level</li>
    </ul>
