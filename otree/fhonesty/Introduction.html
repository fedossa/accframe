        This is an experiment in corporate decision making that runs over 
        {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds. 
        In it, you will take the role of a unit manager that produces 
        products that are sold to customers in an external market. The price
        of product is fixed at {{ price }} US-$ and each round you will sell 
        a quantity of {{ quantity }} units. To produce the goods, you need
        a cost budget from your company's headquarters. 
        In each round, you will receive a compensation of {{ C.COMPENSATION }} 
        US-$ regardless of your choices. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        Each period, you will learn the total costs that it will take to produce 
        the demanded goods. The total costs will be univariately distributed 
        between {{ C.MIN_POOL }} to {{ C.MAX_POOL }} US-$ in {{ C.STEP }} US-$ 
        increments. 
        You are then required to file these costs as a budget request 
        with your company's headquarters to finance production. 
        This budget request needs at the minimum be large enough to cover your 
        production costs. But also if you decide to 
        file an inflated budget request, your company's headquarters will
        grant you the requested amount as it is unable to 
        tell your miss-reporting. The resulting budget slack will increase
        your private wealth but at the same time reduce your company's profits 
        that are defined as the differential between product revenues and your 
        filed budget request.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your company's headquarter is informed about the general distribution of 
        production costs but will never learn whether you inflated your budget
        in any specific round. In any case, your budget request needs to be 
        at least as large as the true costs. Also, it cannot be higher than
        {{ C.MAX_POOL}} US-$ as in that case the company's headquarters would
        know for sure that the budget is inflated. 
        Also, it has to be a multiple of {{ C.STEP }} US-$. 
        Your total payoff is equal to the sum of 
        your compensations and any potential budget slacks over all rounds.
