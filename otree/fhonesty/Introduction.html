        This is an experiment on budgeting in organizations.
        In the experiment, there are two roles: division manager and firm corporate headquarters.
        Your will act as division manager, the computer of the organizers will act as the firm's corporate headquarters.

        In the experiment, you can earn points. 
        Points will be exchanged for money at the end of the experiment.

            The experiment consists of {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds.
            Throughout the experiment, you will remain in the role of the division manager.
            The points that you earn in each round are added up.

        task as division manager is to report the production costs of your division for the 
        upcoming period to the firm's corporate headquarters in the form of a budget request. 
        As division manager you have access to a reliable private forecasting 
        system that allows you to accurately predict what the actual production 
        costs will be before you submit your budget request to the 
        firm's corporate headquarters.
        The firm's corporate headquarters does not have access to this forecasting system.
        Both you and the firm's corporate headquarters know the 
        probability distribution of the production costs that you need to report. 
        This probability distribution is a uniform distribution with a 
        minimum of 4,000 points, a maximum of 6,000 points, and possible 
        increments of 50 points.
        The firm will sell 1,000 units of the product that is produced 
        by your division for a sales price of 6 points per unit. Thus the 
        firm will earn a sales revenue of 1,000 x 6 = 6,000 points. 
        You can make any budget request that is between the actual costs 
        and 6,000 (the maximum costs), including these values. 
        The firm's corporate headquarters will always fund your request independent 
        of what the actual costs are.
        The difference between the requested budget and the actual costs is yours to keep.
        As division manager, you also receive a fixed wage of 250 points.
        Thus, your payoff will be determined as follows: 250 + (cost budget - actual cost).

        Here are two examples.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Example 1: Suppose your forecasting system tells you that the 
                actual production costs are 5,000 points
                and you also request a budget of 5,000 points. 
                Then your payoff is 250 + (5,000 - 5,000) = 250 points.
            </li>
            <li>
                Example 2: Suppose your forecasting system tells you that the 
                actual production costs are 4,500 points
                and you request a budget of 5,500 points. 
                Then your payoff is 250 + (5,500 - 4,500) = 1,250 points.
            </li>
        </ul>
