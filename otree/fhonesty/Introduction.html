        This is an experiment on budgeting in organizations.
        Your objective in this experiment is maximizing your points.
        Your role in the experiment is division manager in a firm.
        You will be interacting with the computer of the organizers, which will 
        represent the firm's corporate headquarters.
        Your task is to report the production costs of your division for the 
        upcoming period to the firm's corporate headquarters in the form 
        of a budget request. 
        As division manager you have access to a reliable private forecasting 
        system that allows you to accurately predict what the actual production 
        costs will be before you submit your budget request to the 
        firm's corporate headquarters.
        The firm's corporate headquarters does not have access to this forecasting system.
        Both you and corporate headquarters know the 
        probability distribution of the number that you need to report. 
        This probability distribution is a uniform distribution with a 
        minimum of 4,000 points, a maximum of 6,000 points, and possible 
        increments of 50 points.
        The firm will sell 1,000 units of the product that is produced 
        by your division for a sales price of 6 points per unit. Thus the 
        firm will earn a sales revenue of 1,000 x 6 = 6,000 points. 
        You can make any budget request that is between the actual costs 
        and the maximum costs, including these values. 
        Corporate headquarters will always fund your request independent 
        of what the actual costs are.
        The difference between the requested budget and the actual costs is yours to keep.
        As manager, you also receive a fixed wage of 250 points.
        Thus, your payoff will be determined as follows: 250 + (budget cost - actual cost).

        Here are two examples.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Example 1: Suppose your forecasting system tells you that the 
                actual production costs are 5,000 
                and you also request a budget of 5,000. 
                Then your payoff is 250 + (5,000 - 5,000) = 250.
            </li>
            <li>
                Example 2: Suppose your forecasting system tells you that the 
                actual production costs are 4,500 
                and you request a budget of 5,500. 
                Then your payoff is 250 + (5,500 - 4,500) = 1,250.
            </li>
        </ul>
