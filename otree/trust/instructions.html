    <p>
        This is an experiment on decision-making.
        Your objective in this experiment is maximizing your points. 
        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
        In the experiment, there are two roles: participant A and participant B.
        The roles are randomly assigned to you and the other participant. 
        You will learn whether your role is participant A or participant B prior to making any decision.

        {{ if C.NUM_ROUNDS == 1 }}
            This experiment lasts only 1 round.
        {{ else }} 
            This experiment lasts {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds.
        {{ endif }}

        The rules are as follows.
        {{ if C.NUM_ROUNDS > 1 }} 
            Each round, participant A
        {{ else }} 
            Participant A
        {{ endif }}
        starts with an endowment of {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} points and participant B starts with an endowment of 0 points.
        Participant A can send none, some, or all of their endowment to participant B.
        Each point that participant A sends to participant B is multiplied by 3.
        Participant B then needs to decide how much of this multiplied amount they send back to participant A.
        Anything that participant B does not send back to participant A, they can keep for themselves.  
        {{ if C.NUM_ROUNDS > 1 }}
            The points that both participants receive in each round are accumulated. 
        {{ endif }}

        <b>Example</b>
        Suppose that participant A chooses to send 50 points to participant B. 
        This amount is then multiplied by 3, such that participant B now 
        has 150 points. Suppose participant B sends back 50 points to 
        participant A. The payoff of participant A then is 100 points 
        (100 - 50 + 50) and the payoff of participant B then is 100 points 
        (0 + 150 - 50).
