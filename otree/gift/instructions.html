<p> 
    This is an experiment on decision-making.
    You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
    In the experiment, there are two roles: Participant A and Participant B.
    The roles are randomly assigned to you and the other participant. 
    You will learn whether your role is Participant A or Participant B prior to making any decision.
</p>
<p>
    In the experiment, you and the other participant can earn points. 
    Points will be exchanged for money at the end of the experiment.

    {{ if C.NUM_ROUNDS > 1 }}
        This experiment consists of {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds.
        Throughout the experiment, you will remain in the same role.
        The points that you earn in each round are added up.
        A round proceeds as follows:
    {{ endif }}
    Participant A starts with an endowment of 100 points. 
    Participant B starts with an endowment of 0 points.
    First, Participant A decides how many points they want to transfer to Participant B.
    The amount transferred can be any integer between 0 and {{ C.WAGE_MAX }}.
    Next, Participant B selects a multiplier from the table below. 
    The multiplier selected by Participant B determines the payoff of Participant A.
    Specifically, the payoff of Participant A is calculated as follows:
</p>
<p>
    (100 - transfer to Participant B) * multiplier. 
</p>
<p>
    Participant B can select multipliers between 0.1 and 1.0. 
    Higher multipliers are more costly for Participant B. 
</p>
<p>
    In summary, the payoffs are calculated as follows:
</p>        
<ul>
    <li>Payoff Participant A = (100 - transfer to Participant B) * multiplier </li>
    <li>Payoff Participant B = Transfer received from Participant A - cost of multiplier </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Example:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Suppose that Participant A chooses to transfer 40 points to Participant B 
            and Participant B then chooses the multiplier 0.7, which costs 10 points. 
            The payoff of Participant A then is (100 points - 40 points) * 0.7 = 42 points. 
            The payoff of Participant B then is 40 points - 10 points = 30 points.
        </li>
    </ul>
