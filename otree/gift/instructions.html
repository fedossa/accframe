<p> 
    This is an experiment on decision-making.
    Your objective in this experiment is maximizing your points. 
    You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
    In the experiment, there are two roles: participant A and participant B.
    The roles are randomly assigned to you and the other participant. 
    You will learn whether your role is participant A or participant B prior to making any decision.

<p>
    {{ if C.NUM_ROUNDS == 1 }}
        This experiment will be played for only 1 round. Participant A
    {{ else }} 
        This experiment will be played over {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds.
        The points that you receive in each round are accumulated.
        Throughout the experiment, you will remain in the same role.
        Each round, participant A
    {{ endif }}
    starts with an endowment of 100 points 
    and participant B starts with an endowment of 0 points.
    First, participant A decides how many points they want to transfer to participant B.
    The amount transferred can be any integer between 0 and {{ C.WAGE_MAX }}.
    Next, participant B selects a multiplier from the table below. 
    The multiplier selected by participant B determines the payoff of participant A.
    Specifically, the payoff of participant A is calculated as follows:
</p>
<p>
    (100 - transfer to participant B) * multiplier. 
</p>
<p>
    Participant B can select multipliers between 0.1 and 1.0. 
    Higher multipliers are more costly for participant B. 
</p>
<p>
    In summary, the payoffs are calculated as follows:
</p>        
<ul>
    <li>Payoff participant A = (100 - transfer to participant B) * multiplier </li>
    <li>Payoff participant B = Transfer received from participant A - cost of multiplier </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Example:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Suppose that participant A chooses to transfer 30 points to participant B 
            and participant B then chooses the multiplier 0.7, which costs 10 points. 
            The payoff of participant A then is (100 points - 30 points) * 0.7 = 49 points. 
            The payoff of participant B then is 30 points - 10 points = 20 points.
        </li>
    </ul>
