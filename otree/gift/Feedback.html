    <p>
        Thank you for taking these comprehension checks.
        Let's see whether you understood how the payoffs are determined.
    </p>
    <p>
        The setting was: 
        "Participant A sends an amount of 10 and participant B decides for an effort cost of 2."
    </p>
    <p>You answered</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Participant A's payoff is {{ player.comprehension_check_pre1 }}.</li>
        <li>Participant B's payoff is {{ player.comprehension_check_pre2 }}.</li>
    </ul>
    {{ if both_correct }}
        <p>
            <strong>Great! You answered both questions correctly.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Below you can find the calculation of the payoffs for this 
            setting and a copy of the instructions from the previous page

            <strong>
                Unfortunately, you answered at least one question incorrectly.

            Please carefully inspect the calculations below to understand
            where your mistake was. You can also review the instructions
            from the previous page copied below for your reference.

        The payoffs of the participants for the setting below are
        calculated as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each round, the initial wealth of participant A is 100. 
            Participant B has no initial wealth.</li>
        <li>Participant A sent an amount of 10 to Participant B, 
            reducing her or his initial wealth from 100 to 90.</li>
        <li>Participant B decided for an effort cost of 2.</li>
        <li>Following the table below this implies an effort multiplier of 0.3.</li>
        <li>Participant's B payoff is 10 (the amount received) 
            - 2 (the effort cost) = <strong>8</strong>.</li>
        <li>Participant A's payoff is the 
            effort multiplier corresponding to participant B's choice (0.3)
            multiplied with the initial wealth after 
            sending the amount (100 - 10 = 90) = <strong>27</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
