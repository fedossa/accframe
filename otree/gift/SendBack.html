        A sent you an amount of {{ group.wage }}. Based on this you can 
        choose your effort level, inducing effort costs. These effort costs
        will reduce your payoff and determine the payoff of participant A 
        by setting the effort multiple as detailed in the table below. 
        
        Remember that the payoff of participant A will be calculated as the 
        product of the effort multiplier with the difference of her or his 
        initial wealth of 100 minus the amount sent to you.       
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your Payoff = Amount received from A - Effort Cost</li>
        <li>Payoff A = Effort multiplier chosen by you * (100 - Amount sent to you)</li>
    </ul>
