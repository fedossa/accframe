        A sent you {{ group.wage }}. Based on this you can choose your 
        return payment. This return payment will reduce your payoff and 
        determine the payoff of participant A by setting the multiple as 
        detailed in the table below. Remember that the payoff of participant A
        will be based on the difference of 100 minus the payment to you.
        This difference will be multiplied by the multiplier that corresponds
        to the payment that you will choose to determine the payoff of 
        participant A.
