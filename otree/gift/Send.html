        have received an initial endowment of 100 and have to decide on the amount 
        that you will send to participant B.
        This amount can be any integer between 0 and {{ C.WAGE_MAX }}.
        Based on the amount that they has received, participant B 
        will choose an multiplier, inducing a cost.
        Below, you will again find the table that links the multiplier 
        that participant B can choose to its cost for your reference.
        This multiplier will determine your payoff. Your payoff 
        will be calculated as the product of the multiplier with
        the difference of your endowment of 100 points minus the amount 
        sent to participant B.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your payoff = (100 - amount sent by you) * multiplier set by participant B</li>
        <li>Payoff participant B = amount sent by you - cost of multiplier</li>
    </ul>
