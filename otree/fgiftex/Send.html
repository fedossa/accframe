        received an initial endowment of 100 points and have to decide on the wage 
        that you will pay to the manager.
        This wage can be any integer between 0 and {{ C.WAGE_MAX }} points.
        After observing the wage they received, the manager 
        will select their effort level. 
        Effort is costly to the manager.
        Below, you will find a table that shows the effort levels 
        that the manager can choose from and their costs to the manager.
        The effort level that the manager chooses determines your payoff. 
        Your payoff will be calculated as (your endowment - wage you paid to the manager) times the effort level selected by the manager.
        The payoff of the manager will be calculated as the wage that you paid to the manager minus the cost of the effort level selected by the manager.
        In summary:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your payoff = (100 - wage paid to the manager) * effort level selected by the manager</li>
        <li>Payoff manager = wage paid by you to the manager - cost of effort level selected by the manager</li>
    </ul>
