    <p>
    This is a short experiment in corporate decision-making. 
    Your objective in this experiment is maximizing your points.
    You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
    In the experiment, there are two roles: an accountant and the firm.
    The roles are randomly assigned to you and the other participant. 
    You have been assigned the role of the accountant. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Two possible point payments are available to you and the firm
    in the experiment. The two payment options are:
    <ul>
        <li>Investment A: {{ C.AMOUNT_A1 }} points to you and 
            {{ C.AMOUNT_A2 }} points to the firm.
        </li>
    </li>
        <li>Investment B: {{ C.AMOUNT_B1 }} points to you and 
            {{ C.AMOUNT_B2 }} points to the firm.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The choice rests with the firm who will have 
        to choose either investment A or investment B. 
        The firm is informed that one investment favors you and 
        the other option favors them but they do not know the point 
        payments associated with each investment so they cannot tell 
        which is which.
        The only information the firm will have is information sent 
        by you in a message.
    </p>
    <p>
        We now ask you to choose one of the following two possible messages, 
        which you will send to the firm:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Message 1: “Investment A will earn you more points than investment B.”
        </li>
        <li>
            Message 2: “Investment B will earn you more points than investment A.”
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We will show the firm your message, and ask them 
        to choose either investment A or B. To repeat, the firm's choice will 
        determine the point payments in the experiment. However, the firm
        will never know what points were actually offered for the investment not 
        chosen (that is, they will never know whether your message was 
        true or not). Moreover, they will never know the points to be 
        awarded to you according to the different investments.
