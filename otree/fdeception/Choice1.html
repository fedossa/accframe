        This is a short experiment on corporate behavior. 
        In this experiment, you will represent the role of a corporate 
        accountant that has to inform corporate headquarters about the 
        desirability of two alternative investment opportunities. 
    </p>
    <p>   
        Corporate headquarters is  represented by another participant. 
        There are two alternative investments A and B. Only you (the accountant) 
        can observe their actual profitability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both investments create private payoff to you and to corporate
        headquarters These are the payoffs of the two investment options:
    <ul>
        <li>Investment A: ${{ C.AMOUNT_A1 }} to you and 
            ${{ C.AMOUNT_A2 }} to corporate headquarters.
        </li>
    </li>
        <li>Investment B: ${{ C.AMOUNT_B1 }} to you and 
            ${{ C.AMOUNT_B2 }} to corporate headquarters.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In the end, corporate headquarters will decide which investment
        to make and this decision will determine the payoffs.
        But they will make this decision solely informed the accounting report
        that you send about the two investment options.   
    </p>
    <p>
        Which accounting report do you want to send to corporate headquarters?
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Accounting Report 1: 
            “Investment A will be more profitable to you then investment B.”
        </li>
        <li>
            Accounting Report 2: 
            “Investment B will be more profitable to you then investment A.”
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Corporate headquarters will receive your accounting report, and based 
        on this to choose either investment A or B. To repeat, this investment
        decision will determine the payments in the experiment. However, 
        corporate headquarters will never learn the actual payoffs of the 
        investment that they did not pick (that is, they will never know 
        whether your accounting report was true or not). Moreover, they will 
        never know the payoffs that you received according to the different 
        options.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this experiment, we will pay the you and the participant representing
        corporate headquarters according to the choice made by corporate
        headquarters. The payment will be made in private.
