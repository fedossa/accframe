    <p>
        This is a short experiment in decision making. 
        Your objective in this experiment is maximizing your points.
        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
        In the experiment, there are two roles: an accountant and the firm.
        The roles are randomly assigned to you and the other participant. 
        You have been assigned the role of the firm. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Two possible points payments are available to you and the accountant 
        in the experiment. The payments depend on an investment 
        chosen by you. 
        Both investments have divergent payments to you and the accountant, 
        meaning that one option favors you and the other option favors 
        the accountant. 
        We showed the two investments and their payments to the accountant. 
        The only information you will have is the message the accountant 
        sends to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two possible messages could be sent:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Message 1: “Investment A will earn you more points than investment B.”
        </li>
        <li>
            Message 2: “Investment B will earn you more points than investment A.”
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The accountant decided to send you the message {{message}}.
    </p>
    <p>
        We now ask you to choose either investment A or investment B. 
        Your choice will determine the point payments in the experiment. 
        You will never know what points were actually offered for the 
        investment not chosen (that is, if the message sent by your 
        counterpart was true or not). Moreover, you will never know 
        the points that the accountant could be awarded with either option.
        We will awards points to the two of you according to the investment 
        you choose.
