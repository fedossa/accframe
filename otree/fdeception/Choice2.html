        This is a short experiment on corporate behavior. 
        In this experiment, you will represent the role of corporate 
        headquarters that has to decide between to alternative investment
        options A and B. You are informed about the relative favorability
        of these two investment options by receiving a report from an
        accountant. inform corporate headquarters about the 
        desirability of two alternative investment opportunities. 
    </p>
    <p>   
        This accountant is represented by another experimental participant.
        As an accountant, he is able to observe the payoffs of the two 
        investment options. Both options generate a payoff to you (corporate
        headquarters) and the other participant (the accountant). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on his or her private information, the accountant will send 
        you an accounting report that advises you on which investment to take.
        The payments to both participants then depend on the investment 
        chosen by you. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The accounting report could take one of the following two forms:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Accounting Report 1: 
            “Investment A will be more profitable to you then investment B.”
        </li>
        <li>
            Accounting Report 2: 
            “Investment B will be more profitable to you then investment A.”
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Your accountant decided to send you Report {{message}}.
    </p>
    <p>
        We now ask you to choose either investment A or B. 
        Your choice will determine the payments in the experiment. 
        You will never know the payoffs of the other investment 
        (that is, if the accounting report sent by your 
        accountant was true or not). Moreover, you will never know 
        the payoffs your accountant could be paid with the other investment.
        We will pay the two of you according to the investment you pick.
