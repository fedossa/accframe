        This is an experiment in decision making that runs over {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} 
        rounds. In each round, you will be presented with an amount that is a 
        random draw from a uniform distribution between 4000 to 6000 points 
        in 50 point increments (the true amount). You then have to report this 
        amount. An external party will pay you the amount you report in each
        round. From this reported amount, the true amount will be deducted and 
        you will keep the differential between the amount that you reported and 
        the true amount. In addition, in each round, you will be compensated 
        {{ C.COMPENSATION }} points for your effort. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Nobody will ever learn whether you miss-reported the true amount. 
        In any case, the reported amount needs to be at least as large as the
        true amount and at most 6000 points. Also, it has to be a multiple of 
        50 points. You objective is to maximize the points that you receive 
        over all rounds.
