        This is an experiment on decision-making.
        Your objective in this experiment is maximizing your points.
        Your role in the experiment is decision-maker.
        You will be interacting with the computer of the organizers.
        Your task is to report a number of points to the computer of the organizers.
        You will be privately informed about this number before you will be asked to report it.
        The computer of the organizers will not be informed about the number.
        Both you and the computer of the organizers know the 
        probability distribution of the number that you need to report. 
        This probability distribution is a uniform distribution with a 
        minimum of 4,000 points, a maximum of 6,000 points, and possible 
        increments of 50 points.
        The organizers will start with a total of 6,000 points.
        You can report any number that is between 
        the actual number and the maximum number, including these values. 
        The computer of the organizers will always 
        send you the number of points that you report, independent of what 
        the actual number is. 
        The difference between the reported number and the actual number is yours to keep.
        You will also receive an additional fixed amount of 250 points.
        Thus, your payoff will be determined as follows: 250 + (reported number - actual number).

        Here are two examples.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Example 1: Suppose you observe that the actual number is 5,000 
                and you also report that the number is 5,000. Then your 
                payoff is 250 + (5,000 - 5,000) = 250.
            </li>
            <li>
                Example 2: Suppose you observe that the actual number is 4,500 
                and you report that the number is 5,500. 
                Then your payoff is 250 + (5,500 - 4,500) = 1,250.
            </li>
        </ul>
