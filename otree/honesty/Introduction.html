    <p>
        This is an experiment on decision-making.
        In the experiment, there are two roles: Participant A and Participant B.
        You will act as Participant A, the computer of the organizers will act as Participant B. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the experiment, you can earn points. 
        Points will be exchanged for money at the end of the experiment.

        {{ if C.NUM_ROUNDS > 1 }}
            The experiment consists of {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds.
            Throughout the experiment, you will remain in the role of Participant A.
            The points that you earn in each round are added up.
            Each round, your 
        {{ else }}
            Your
        {{ endif }}
        task as Participant A is to report a number of points to Participant B.
        You will be privately informed about this number before you will be asked to report it.
        Participant B will not be informed about the number.
        Both you and Participant B know the 
        probability distribution of the number that you need to report. 
        This probability distribution is a uniform distribution with a 
        minimum of 4,000 points, a maximum of 6,000 points, and possible 
        increments of 50 points.
        Participant B will start with a total of 6,000 points.
        You can report any number that is between 
        the actual number and 6,000 (the maximum number), including these values. 
        Participant B will always 
        send you the number of points that you report, independent of what 
        the actual number is. 
        The difference between the reported number and the actual number is yours to keep.
        You will also receive an additional fixed amount of 250 points.
        Thus, your payoff will be determined as follows: 250 + (reported number - actual number).
    </p>
    <p>   
        Here are two examples.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Example 1: Suppose you observe that the actual number is 5,000 points 
                and you also report that the number is 5,000 points. Then your 
                payoff is 250 + (5,000 - 5,000) = 250 points.
            </li>
            <li>
                Example 2: Suppose you observe that the actual number is 4,500 points
                and you report that the number is 5,500 points. 
                Then your payoff is 250 + (5,500 - 4,500) = 1,250 points.
            </li>
        </ul>
