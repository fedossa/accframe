    <p>
    This is a short experiment in decision making. 
    Your objective in this experiment is maximizing your points.
    You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
    In the experiment, there are two roles: participant A and participant B.
    The roles are randomly assigned to you and the other participant. 
    You have been assigned the role of participant A. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Two possible point payments are available to you and participant B
    in the experiment. The two payment options are:
    <ul>
        <li>Option A: {{ C.AMOUNT_A1 }} points to you and 
            {{ C.AMOUNT_A2 }} points to participant B.
        </li>
    </li>
        <li>Option B: {{ C.AMOUNT_B1 }} points to you and 
            {{ C.AMOUNT_B2 }} points to participant B.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The choice rests with the participant B who will have 
        to choose either option A or option B. 
        Participant B is informed that one option favors you and 
        the other option favors them but they do not know the point 
        payments associated with each option so they cannot tell 
        which is which.
        The only information on the options that participant B receives 
        is the information sent by you in a message.
    </p>
    <p>
        We now ask you to choose one of the following two possible messages, 
        which you will send to participant B:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Message 1: “Option A will earn you more points than option B.”
        </li>
        <li>
            Message 2: “Option B will earn you more points than option A.”
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We will show the participant B your message, and ask them 
        to choose either option A or B. To repeat, participant B's choice will 
        determine the point payments in the experiment. However, participant B
        will never know what points were actually offered for the option not 
        chosen (that is, they will never know whether your message was 
        true or not). Moreover, they will never know the points to be 
        awarded to you according to the different options.
