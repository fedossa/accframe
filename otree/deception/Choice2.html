    <p>
        This is a short experiment in decision making. 
        Your objective in this experiment is maximizing your points.
        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
        In the experiment, there are two roles: participant A and participant B.
        The roles are randomly assigned to you and the other participant. 
        You have been assigned the role of participant B. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Two possible points payments are available to you and participant A 
        in the experiment. The payments depend on the option 
        chosen by you. 
        Both options have divergent payments to you and participant A, 
        meaning that one option favors you and the other option favors 
        participant A. 
        We showed the two options and their payments to participant A. 
        The only information you will have is the message participant A 
        sends to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two possible messages could be sent:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Message 1: “Option A will earn you more points than option B.”
        </li>
        <li>
            Message 2: “Option B will earn you more points than option A.”
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Participant A decided to send you the message {{message}}.
    </p>
    <p>
        We now ask you to choose either option A or option B. 
        Your choice will determine the point payments in the experiment. 
        You will never know what points were actually offered for the 
        option not chosen (that is, if the message sent by participant A 
        was true or not). Moreover, you will never know 
        the points that participant A could be awarded with either option.
        We will awards points to the two of you according to the choice you make.
