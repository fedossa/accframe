<p>
    This is an experiment on decision-making by managers and investors.
    You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
    The roles of manager and investors are randomly assigned to you and the 
    other participant. 
    You will learn your role prior to making any decision.
</p>
<p>
    During the experiment, you and the other participant can earn points. 
    The amount of points that you earned will determine the likelihood that 
    you will win an 50â‚¬ Amazon voucher that will be raffled out among
    the app. 50 participants in this experiment.
</p>
<p>
    After the role assignment, the manager has the option 
    to send a free form text message to the investor.
    Only the manager can send a message and 
    they can only send one message at the beginning of the experiment.

    {{ if C.NUM_ROUNDS > 1 }}
        This experiment lasts {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds.
    {{ endif }}
    {{ if C.NUM_ROUNDS > 1 }} 
        Each round, the investor
    {{ else }} 
        The investor
    {{ endif }}
    starts with an endowment of {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} and the manager starts with an endowment of 0 points.
    The investor can invest none, some, or all of their endowment in the firm run by the manager.
    Each point that the investor invests in the firm run by the manager is multiplied by 3.
    The manager then needs to decide how much of this multiplied amount they send to the investor as a dividend.
    Anything that the manager does not send to the investor, they can keep for themselves.  
</p>
<p>
    <b>Example</b>:
    Suppose that the investor chooses to invest 50 points. 
    This amount is then multiplied by 3, such that the manager now 
    has 150 points. Suppose the manager sends back 50 points to 
    the investor. The payoff of the investor then is 100 points 
    (100 - 50 + 50) and the payoff of the manager then is 100 points 
    (0 + 150 - 50).
